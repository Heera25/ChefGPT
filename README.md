The Bookmarks Page serves as a virtual recipe organizer, allowing users to easily revisit and reference their favorite dishes whenever inspiration strikes.

# Community page
The community page encourages user engagement through recipe sharing, cooking advice exchange, and personalized recommendations derived from a hybrid enhanced recommendation system. 
The system combines various recommendation techniques, including cosine similarity for content-based recommendations, collaborative filtering through methods like popularity-based recommendation, K Means clustering, and ANN (Neural Collaborative Filtering - NCF). 
Users can like their favourite dishes by swiping to the right, after which they can see the details of the dish. 

By integrating these approaches, the system delivers more accurate and diverse recommendations, enhancing the overall user experience and fostering a vibrant culinary community.

# Novelty
While existing methodologies make use of either K-Means Clustering or Deep learning Models for the purpose of collaborative filtering based recommendation systems, our app utilises a hybrid recommendation system combining collaborative filtering using matrix factorization followed by K-Means Clustering, Artificial Neural Networks, popularity based recommendation and content-based recommendation using cosine similarity. Comparison of results can be performed using averaged RMSE and averaged MSE values
